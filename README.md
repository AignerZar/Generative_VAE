# Generative_VAE
GitHub repository for a generative Variational Autoencoder to sample Path Integral Monte Carlo configurations.
In the VAE various EGCL layers are implemented, whereas here I want to cite the following papers:


## Input
For the training and validation dataset, Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) configurations are used, which were calculated beforehand by Michael Hütter. The PIMC configurations are computed for H2O with 4 and 15 beads per molecule. Whereas the H2O molecule with 4 beads can be found in the file "final_input_H2O_4.csv" and the H2O molecule with 15 beads can be found in the file "input_H2O.csv".

## Workflow
